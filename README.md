# Skeleton Ghost Theme

This is a Skeleton Ghost Theme with Bootstrap 4 Installed. It's a "Blank Slate" for Ghost CMS. Ghost doesn't have a simple "Bootstrap" theme, which is why I have gone about creating it. Completely free to use and edit. If you have any updates you'd like to add - or - features you'd like to see added to the Barebones theme just create a new issue or submit a pull request.

## Features ##

* Bootstrap Installed. (Can easily be removed).
* Zero Overheads or Weird Scripts.
* Ghost Default Editor styles installed.
* Default Loops.
* 100/100 on Ghost Theme Compatibility.
* Loads assets via Ghost's Asset Helper.
* Doesn't Include Ghost Link. Do this at your discretion.

## Installing ##

- Download the Git Repo.
- Zip it up.
- Add the theme to your Ghost site.
